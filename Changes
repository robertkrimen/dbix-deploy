TODO:
 - ::Engine::run_file $file

 - ::Engine::run_file [ $directory, $name, $suffixes ]
            (can result in "run_directory" ... stop on first matching directory/file found)

 - ::Engine::run_directory $directory
            recursively run through directory, "executing" in alphabetical order

 - Integrate File::Ignore so we do the right thing in run_directory()
